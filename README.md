# QG_DNS
A spectral code for both two-equal-layer QG and two-surface QG in a periodic domain

The matlab script Driver.m runs the simulation. 

All the parameters are set in the script Initialize.m

QG_RHS.m computes the advection terms (including beta) and bottom friction. It does not compute the hyperdiffusive PV dissipation term.

Versions of this code were used, for example, in the following papers
